      <h1>Go+Wasm image dithering tool</h1>
      <aside>Featuring the Nord Color Palette</aside>
      <p>
        Load an image, click Go and wait (potentially for a while) for the image
        to be dithered using the Nord color palette and the Floyd-Steinberg
        algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Running in the browser with Wasm causes a bit of a performance penalty.
        Multithreading is not available (not that it matters much since
        Floyd-Steinberg is single-threaded), and sending data back and forth
        between JS and Wasm can take a little while.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've re-used code from
        <a
          href="https://www.sitepen.com/blog/using-webassembly-with-web-workers"
        >
          this article
        </a>
        to make the Wasm code run in a web worker, with some adaptations for Go
        oddities.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're into that sort of thing, source code is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/CrispyBaguette/wasm-palette-converter">
          GitHub
        </a>
        .
